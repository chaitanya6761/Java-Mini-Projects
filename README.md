## 1. Route Finder â€“ A Mapping Application:
In this project I developed a mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map. This project uses Google Maps API as a front end. The backend implementation has various graph traversing algorithms like Bfs, Dfs, Dijkstra and A*.
